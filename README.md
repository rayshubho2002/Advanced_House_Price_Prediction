**README for House Price Prediction Model**

**Introduction** This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. The model has been developed with a focus on data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to ensure high accuracy in predictions.

**Dataset** The project includes two CSV files:

- **train.csv:** This file contains the training dataset used to train the machine learning model.
- **test.csv:** This file contains the test dataset used to evaluate the performance of the model.
Both datasets have undergone thorough cleaning processes to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant information that could affect model performance.

**Data Cleaning** Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing the datasets for analysis. In this project, the following steps were taken:

**1. Handling Missing Values:** Any missing values in both training and testing datasets were addressed through imputation or removal, depending on their significance.
**2.Outlier Detection:** Outliers were identified and treated to prevent them from skewing the results of the regression analysis.
**3.Feature Encoding:** Categorical variables were converted into numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
**4.Data Analysis and Visualization** Comprehensive data analysis was performed to understand the relationships between different features and house prices. Key steps included:

**1.Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics were generated for all features to identify trends and patterns.
**2.Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix was created to visualize relationships between features and target variables, helping identify which features are most predictive of house prices.
**3.Visualizations:** Various plots (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, box plots) were created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate findings visually.
**Model Development** The machine learning model employs advanced regression techniques such as:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
Each modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
